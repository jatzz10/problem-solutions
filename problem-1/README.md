# Problem Statement

Your computer is dumb. You have to figure out a logic for your computer so that if you provide a list of 
numbers like this - [1,2,3,4,5] as input to the computer, it should give you back a list like this - [120,60,40,30,24] 
as output (basically, every element in the list should be the “product of rest of the numbers , other than itself”).
